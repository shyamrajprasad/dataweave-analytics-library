# DataWeave Library Extension

The DataWeave extension adds language support that enables you to develop, debug, and test DataWeave scripts.

The DataWeave extension also enables you to quickly start creating DataWeave libraries by:

* Guiding you through project creation and setup
* Easing your development efforts by offering autocompletion, navigation, and reactors features
* Facilitating testing by providing DataWeave Testing Framework (Beta) and debugger

**Requirements**
  * Java 8 or 11 provided
  * Apache Maven
  * Microsoft Visual Studio Code for your specific operating system
  * DataWeave 2.0 (BETA) library in VS code (Extensions tab)

**Developing DataWeave Libraries**
A DataWeave library is a reusable package of DataWeave module and mapping files, and resource files, such as JSON, XML, and CSV. To develop DataWeave libraries, first create a new DataWeave project in Visual Studio Code where you then create, preview, and test custom mappings and modules.

**Steps to publish the library**
* Clone the repo
* open the project in vs code
* change the ORGANIZATION_ID to your anypoint cloudhub org id in pom.xml(3 places)
* Update the username and password of anypoint login in maven-settingx.xml 
* Run the mvn deploy -s maven-settings.xml
* Validate the dataweave library in anypoint exchange.
* Copy the dependency snippets of dataweave library and use in sample anypoint studio project to test the dataweave module.
* Also try to run, debug and test your module, mapping, unit test and integration test in vs code.
